I am an AI/ML researcher and product-focused scientist with a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech, experienced in applying advanced machine learning, graph analytics, and neuroimaging research to solve complex real-world problems. At the TReNDS Center, I have led cross-functional projects that translate cutting-edge algorithms into actionable insights for healthcare and technology, while managing teams, timelines, and deliverables across multi-institutional collaborations. Passionate about bridging research and industry, I bring a strong foundation in data-driven innovation, stakeholder communication, and product-oriented problem solving.
